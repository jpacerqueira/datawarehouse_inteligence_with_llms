## Initialising your repository

This template repo comes with a GHA workflow that takes care of the standard repository settings. This documentation (with screenshots) will also available on [Confluence](#) in due course.

To use the workflow:

1. Create an ephemeral personal access token with the following permissions:
   - `repo`
   - `write:org`
2. Be sure to configure SSO for the token (click `Configure SSO` and then authorize Sage)
3. Add the access token as a repository secret named `INITIALISE_REPO_PAT`
4. Under Actions, dispatch the `Initialise Repository` workflow

This should do the following:

- Create environments `dev1`, `qa1`, `sbx`, `prod`, with a protection rule from `qa1` upward
- Set generic defaults, such as the default branch (`main`), PR policies, etc
- Add branch protection for `main`
- Add the flux teams, with appropriate permissions

On success:

1. Revoke the PAT
2. Delete the `init-repo.yaml` workflow
3. Delete this section from your repo's README and update the title to match your repo name

On fail:

1. Hope for the best ðŸ¥¹
